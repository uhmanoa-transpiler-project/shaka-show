##argParse
    When a source file is submitted to the program, the parse_args() function is responsible for taking in the filename, the port number assigned to the source file (if no port number given, the default is '8888'), and each individual line of code in the source file. The function should be able to take in all whitespace before each newline and should be able to read in any empty newlines as well. As of right now, parse_args() is able to take in and print a port number (or assign '8888' if there is no port number given), take in a source file, and print the file name and an exact copy of the code in the source file.
