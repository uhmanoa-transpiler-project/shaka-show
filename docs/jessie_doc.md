#task 1: render the source code tracker

Today I worked on rendering the panels into the main page. I worked with Paulo setting up the template to parse in the dict from the panelargs to the codetracker file

#task 2: html & css freeCodeCamp lessons

I finished the module on html and css to learn more about how to edit the style of the webpage.
